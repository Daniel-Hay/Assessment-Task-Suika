# Assessment-Task
The problem I am trying to solve through my software is the world-wide human desire for dopamine and an escape from reality, curing boredom at the same time. This will be done through creating a game influenced by the popular Japanese game, Suika. This puzzle game integrates elements of both falling and merging physics slightly resemblant of Tetris but with circles and more flowing physics. The aim of the game is to keep all the balls in the container without overflowing through combining the same type of ball to create bigger objects. The main requirements of the software is to have: simple user input with realistic physics and a merging system that combines like objects.

User Manual:
My assessment game is heavily inspired by the Japanese game Suika, where the aim of the game is to combine different objects together whilst not going over the container. The controls for the game are simple with mouse movement controlling the x axis whilst the y axis is clamped slightly above the container, much like Tetris. ‘Spacebar’ is used to drop the ball whenever you feel like is in the right place. There are 4 total different balls with different widths, with the 4th ball having the largest radius. By combining the same type of ball through making them touch, a bigger ball is formed until it becomes the 4th ball.
